R Problem Set 1
1. What class of object is mtcars? What function did you use to find out?
Class of Object: data.frame 
Function: >class(mtcars)

2. Is precip defined as a 1-dimensional array or a vector? How did you find out?
I used the function: >is (precip, “vector”) to determine that  it is a vector.

3. How would you convert the data.frame trees into a matrix?
Use the function:
> as(trees,"matrix")

4. What is the name of the 14th city in the precip dataset?
>precip[14] is Atlanta

5. What function would you use if you wanted to combine all three data sets into a single object?
>MyList<-list(mtcars,trees,precip)
>MyList

6. Does precip consist of numeric data? How did you find out?
Yes it is.
> is(precip,"numeric")
[1] TRUE

7. Code four different ways to subscript the 2nd row and 7th column of mtcars using bracket notation - i.e., 17.02.
1) > mtcars[2,7]
2) > mtcars[2,"qsec"]
3)> mtcars[ ,"qsec"][2]
4)> mtcars[ ,7][2]




8. How would you change the precipitation values of "Juneau", "Phoenix", and "Sacramento" to 23, 46, and 12 in the precip dataset. (Hint: You will need to use subscripts and the <- operator).
Use the input:
>precip[“Juneau”]<-23
> precip["Phoenix"]<-46
>precip[“Sacramento”]<-12

9. Are there any trees in the trees dataset with more girth than volume? How did you find out?
No. I used the code: 
> trees["Girth"]>trees["Volume"]
and verified that the result was FALSE for every row of the trees dataset.

10. Take the sum of all elements in column height of the trees dataset, call this value A. Take the sum of all elements in row Valiant of the mtcars dataset, call this value B. Take the sum of the first 8 elements of the precip dataset, call this value C. Divide C by B and add A. What is your final answer?
2356.628

Codes:
> sum(trees["Height"])
[1] 2356
> A<-2356
> sum(mtcars[6, ])
[1] 385.54
> B<-385.54
> sum(precip[1:8])
[1] 242.1
>C<-242.1
> C/B+A
[1] 2356.628
R Problem Set 2
Section 1 Questions
What does the REPLACE= argument of the sample( ) function do?
It allows you to take a sample larger than the population.

Using as(MyMatrix,"numeric") will not convert MyMatrix to numeric data! Can you think of a property of logicals that you can use to convert the logicals to 0's and 1's other than the as( ) function?
R converts True to 1 and False to 0 if you perform a basic mathematical operation on a logical data array like MyMatrix. So if you input
>MyMatrix*1
into R then the logicals in MyMatrix are converted to 0’s and 1’s

If you wanted to check if all of the elements in each row are true, how would you do this?
Use the following input:
> all(MyMatrix)
[1] FALSE
Section 2 Questions
1. How many times does the number 7 occur in MyMatrix?
16
> MyMatrix[which(MyMatrix==7)]
 [1] 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7

2. How do you find the sum of each column?
Use the input below:
> apply(MyMatrix,2,sum)
[1] 51 37 45 58 47 54 51 46 53 42 59 42

3. How do you find the product of each column?
Use the input below:
> apply(MyMatrix,2,prod)
 [1]  290304   46656  123480 3402000  340200 1080000 1975680   79380  987840
[10]  134400 4838400   72000

4. How would you change every instance of the number 10 to 12?
Use the input below:
> MyMatrix[which(MyMatrix==10)]<-12

5. How many values in MyMatrix are greater than 3 and less than 8?
33
Input:
> which(MyMatrix<8 & MyMatrix>3)
 [1]  4  9 10 11 13 17 20 21 24 27 29 32 34 40 43 47 50 51 53 55 56 60 64 68 69 71 72 75 78 80 86 88 89
> MyMatrix[which(MyMatrix<8 & MyMatrix>3)]<-"OK"
>MyMatrix

6. How do you change the elements of column 12 into character data, while keeping columns 1- 11 as numeric data?\



7. Find which rows of MyMatrix have a sum >70. Make a new version of MyMatrix where the 13th column is a set of TRUE and FALSE values denoting which rows have a sum >70. (Hint: What type of object allows you to store both logical and numeric data at once?)
Problem Set 3
Section 1
1. Write a function that returns the phrase "Hello, World."
> print("Hello, World")
[1] "Hello, World"
Section 2
1. Load the iris dataset we used in the earlier tests. Write a function that takes iris as its argument, and returns three subsets of the data.frame split by the three different types of species (saved as a single object).
> Setosa<-iris[which(iris[,"Species"]=="setosa"),]
> Virginica<-iris[which(iris[,"Species"]=="virginica"),]
> Versicolor<-iris[which(iris[,"Species"]=="versicolor"),]
> MyList<-list(Setosa,Virginica,Versicolor)
> MyList

2. Write a function that takes iris as its argument. The function should, for each row, add Sepal.Length and Petal.Length if Sepal.Width is > 3.1. It should subtract Petal.Length from Sepal.Length if Sepal.Width is <3.1. The answer should be returned as a vector.


3. Load the mtcars dataset we used in the earlier tests. Write a function that takes a number of cylinders as its argument. Have the function return the average miles per gallon (column mpg) for all cars with that many cylinder (column cyl).

4. Write a function that simulates 1,000,000 powerball drawings. A powerball drawing takes a random sample of 5 numbers (without replacement) from 1 through 69, plus one powerball number ranging from 1 through 26. The function should return a single object recording all of your draws.
> MyVector<-c(1:69)
> MyVector
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53
[54] 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69

5. Write a function that take a single set of lottery numbers (as a vector) as its argument. As before, write a function that simulates 1,000,000 powerball drawings. Have the function return a TRUE or FALSE value if you won any of the drawings.
R Problem Set 4 
Load in the precip dataset.
1. What is the mean, median, and standard deviation of precip?
> mean(precip)
[1] 34.88571
> median(precip)
[1] 36.6
> sd(precip)
[1] 13.70665

2. Is precip best visualized using a barplot( ) or hist( )? Why?
A histogram because the barplot creates a bar for every city in the precip dataset, which is a lot. this makes the data more cluttered and difficult to interpret. The histogram organizes the data in a more concise manner, illustrating the distribution and spread more clearly. This is a better way of investigating major trends in the data. 

3. Generate a vector of random numbers drawn from a normal distribution with the same mean, standard deviation, and number of elements as in the precip dataset. Name this vector RandomNormal.
> rnorm(70,mean=34.88571,sd=13.70665)
#say you want to draw five random numbers to make vector
> max(precip)
[1] 67
> runif(5,min=0,max=68)
#(max is 58 because largest number in precip dataset is 67)
> RandomNormal<-c(65.11591,65.75682,21.51479,18.54650,17.62952)
> RandomNormal
[1] 65.11591 65.75682 21.51479 18.54650 17.62952

4. Write a function that tests, based on the means of each distribution, whether it is likely that RandomNormal and precip were drawn from the same underlying distribution.


5. Create a density( ) plot of precip and RandomNormal. Is the test you performed above (question 4) a good or bad indicator of whether the two distributions are identical? Why or why not?
No, the test performed in question 4 is indicative of the likelihood that the samples were drawn from similar sampling distributions. Because we created the RandomNormal vector so that it was drawn from a distribution with the same mean, standard deviation, and number of elements, that means that it makes sense that the probability that they were drawn from the underlying distribution was high for question 4. However, just because the RandomNormal vector was drawn from the same distribution as the precip dataset, it doesn’t mean that the distribution of the RandomNormal vector will be identical to the precip dataset. In fact, it is unlikely that they will be identical because the RandomNormal vector created simply drew 5 values randomly from the entire normal distribution created in for question 3. Therefore, it is unlikely that RandomNormal is a perfect reflection of the distribution of the precip dataset.
