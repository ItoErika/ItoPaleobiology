## Part I

This article explored the question of how biodiversity in different ecosystems may change by the year 2100. To investigate this topic, the authors developed different future scenarios based on interactions, or lack of interactions, between the major drivers of change in global biodiversity which they identified. These determinants included changes atmospheric CO2 concentration, land use, climate, nitrogen deposition, and biotic exchanges. The magnitude of change from 1990 to 2100 in each of these determinants was estimated for ten terrestrial biomes and for freshwater ecosystems. The magnitude of changes were ranked on a scale from one to five. Then, the impact of a unit of change in each driver was estimated for each biome. The intensity of the impact was also ranked on a scale from one to five. To estimate proportional changes in biodiversity by year 2100, multiplying the expected change and biome-sensitivity matrices. Three scenarios were derived for future biodiversity for each biome. One scenario assumed no interactions among drivers of biodiversity change. The second scenario assumed antagonistic interactions, meaning the driver to which the biome is the most sensitive will dictate biodiversity changes. The third scenario assume synergistic interactions, meaning biodiversity will respond in a multiplicative manner to the drivers. From this study, the authors postulated that land-use changes will most likely have the largest impact on biodiversity in terrestrial ecosystems, and biotic exchange will be more influential on freshwater ecosystems. The Mediterranean grassland ecosystem was predicted to experienced the greatest change in biodiversity due to its notable sensitivity to all of the drivers of biodiversity change. The biggest take away from the article however, is for all ecosystems, future changes in biodiversity depend greatly on the interactions between the aforementioned drivers, so the strength of these interactions should be further investigated. 

## Part II

I appreciated that the article touched on the undeniable importance and of future environmental policies on the future state of biodiversity. This is an important factor, that I find is often left out of scientific papers. By presenting the outcomes of the study as scenarios rather than as predictions, the authors leave a lot of room for others to build off of their work in constructive ways. The authors explicitly stressed the need for refinement of the scenarios and further study on the driver interactions. I liked this element of the paper.        

I liked the section of the article that described how the impact of the major causes of biodiversity varied greatly in freshwater ecosystems. It was explained this this variation changed according to proximity to humans, whether the ecosystem is a lake or a stream, and climate conditions. This section was very clear and had an adequate amount of detail such that I felt that I understood why the expected changes and impact of each driver on biodiversity were ranked as they were in tables 3 and 4.         

## Part III

To estimate the expected changes in the major drivers for changes in biodiversity, business-as-usual climate models and IMAGE models were used. I think it could have been interesting to instead of using a single scenario of business-as-usual, use two other climate models, one predicting more rapid climate change the business-as-usual model and one predicting slower climate change or even average temperature drops. I personally would find this interesting because it may account and predict for how biodiversity will change in the face of unexpected events such as methane hydrate releases on the sea floor causing rapid warming, or for possible cooling due to some other type of environmental or carbon cycle perturbations. 

In the portion of the paper where the authors were explaining why certain biomes were given certain impact rankings for each driver, only a vague description of the ranking process was given. For each driver of biodiversity change, a short paragraph was devoted, explaining the biomes most and least impacted by each driver. This gave some idea of relative impacts of the drivers on each biome, however, it was unclear as to how these relative impacts were rated on a scale from one through five for each biome. The impact of a change in a unit for each driver is defined in table two. But, I would have liked to know specifically, and in more detail how the impacts on each biome were determined. I therefore, think it would have been more effective to devote a paragraph to each biome explaining the intensity of impact of each driver on that biome.

## Part IV

Tables 1 through 4 displayed the relative ranking system for expected changes in each driver of biodiversity changes and the estimated impact of a change in each driver on biodiversity for each biome. I found these tables to be very useful, as I referenced them repeatedly as I read the article, which helped me digest and apply the data more easily. I think it may have been useful to enlarge each of the tables, adding small comments under each rank number for each biome explaining briefly how or why that rank  was chosen. 
The bar charts (figures 2 and 3) were displayed to show the relative effect of the major drivers on biodiversity on average and within each biome. I thought this was a concise way to visualize the data. It was easy to interpret, and I would not change it. 

Figure 3 illustrates the variations between the three different scenarios on projected future changes in biodiversity by 2100. This clearly demonstrated the high sensitivity to biodiversity on the different types of interactions between the drivers of biodiversity change. However, I think it would have been useful to label each biome on the actual map rather than on the map key to make the figure more digestible.
