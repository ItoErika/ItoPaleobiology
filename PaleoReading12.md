The Red Queen and the Court Jester: Species Diversity and the Role of Biotic and Abiotic Factors Through Time

## Part I

This article investigated how, when, and on what scales biotic and abiotic factors drive evolution. The Red Queen model assumes evolution is mainly a balance of biotic pressures. The Court Jester model assumes evolution, speciation, and extinction processes are rarely active unless there is change in the physical environment. Benton differentiates between taxic and phylogenetic approaches to studying species diversity through time. In the taxic approach, taxonomic groups are treated as independently, and their occurrences are counted against time. The phylogenetic approach utilizes cladograms or molecular trees to investigate clade histories. In this article, Benton looks into how taxic studies align with either the Red Queen or Court Jester model, and into phylogenetic studies of the evolution of species diversity. Benton provided two models for global diversification: the equilibrium model and the expansion model. The equilibrium model is reflective of the Red Queen model, in its assumption that global diversity is density dependent. The expansion model exhibits a dampened rise in species diversity over time, due to limiting factors like food shortage, or predation. Using taxic studies, Benton then described posited large-scale controls on species diversity including plate tectonics, temporal and spatial variance in energy, expansions of ecospace, and niche subdivision or increased specialization. Benton argues the biotic factors, have little impact on species diversity, while abiotic factors seem to be more powerful based on taxic paleobiological studies. Benton then explored phylogenetic studies of clade histories. These studies are often done by comparing a real and ideally complete phylogenetic tree to a hypothetical tree following the equal-rate Markov model, assuming equal probabilities of extinction and speciation for all species. Benton suggests that the dominance of the Red Queen or Court Jester Model can be evaluated, by identifying changes in diversification experienced by numerous taxa. Specifically, if many diversification shifts are associated with a major abiotic change such as a tectonic event or climate change, the Court Jester model of macroevolution is applicable. However, if different clades experience diversification shifts at different times, the Red Queen model is a more likely explanation. Benton discusses phylogenetic studies, involving the comparison of sister taxa. This type of study has been used to confirm the validity of the resource-use model, which supports the role of abiotic drivers in evolutionary processes. Benton concludes that while taxic studies demonstrate correlations between specific factors and species richness, comparative phylogenetic studies offer information about clade dynamics, species richness, and the evolution of novelties. Benton argues both models operate, but over different timescales. The Court Jester model is more applicable over larger geographic scales, and longer timescales, greater than ten thousand years, over which tectonic and climatic processes operate, while the Red Queen model is dominant over shorter timescales. Understanding the respective importance of both of these models is important for the advancement of studies in evolution and diversification.

## Part II

I liked that the author used specific examples of studies to illustrate diversification patterns. He thoroughly explained each study, and their relations to the Red Queen, Court Jester, or Multilevel mixed model. An example of this in the section on comparing sister taxa. Benton described a study of the two antelope subgroups Alcelaphini and Aepycerotini. He explained that the more speciose, Alcelaphini has many short-lived species, while the more generalist Aepycerotini has fewer, longer lived species. He also stated that specialists are more common in habitats that experienced recent environmental change, which supports the Court Jester model in determining species diversity. These example studies, and the explanation of their relevance to each model, made it easy to absorb the main points of the article.

I also liked that Benton touched on the importance of performing sampling corrections which take into account the variable quality of the fossil record. This is always important to consider when presenting data on things such as diversification through earthâ€™s history, which relies on the fossil record for information. By pointing this out, Benton acknowledges the imperfection of the diversification estimates provided.

## Part III

The article was heavily weighted toward studies that demonstrated the Court Jester model or a Multilevel mixed model operating on long timescales, and did not seem to describe any studies which showed the dominance of the Red Queen model at a smaller timescale. Benton thoroughly explained abiotic drivers such as plate tectonics, and climate changes. However, the role of biotic factors like competition, predation, and body size were described as thoroughly. This seemed problematic given that one of the main arguments in the paper is that these models operate on different timescales. Providing at least one study that demonstrated the operation of the Red Queen model on a smaller timescale would have been helpful. 

I also felt that the connection between the models of global diversification over time to the rest of the paper was somewhat unclear. It was unclear whether the purpose of the section was to provide an introductory summary to general diversification patterns through time, or to simply demonstrate the increasing complexity of organisms through time. Perhaps reconnecting to this idea in later parts of the paper, or in the conclusion would have made it more clear.

## Part IV 

Figure 1a gave a graphical representation of the operation of the Red Queen and Court Jester models over different geographic and time scales. It adequately summarizes the general pattern of the Red Queen functioning on smaller geographic and temporal scales, and the Court Jester functioning on larger ones. Figure 1b shows the same general pattern.

Figure 2 showed the marine diversification trend through the Phanerozoic. The figure shows a general increase in diversity through time, and more recent exponential rise. It shows both corrected and uncorrected estimates. The relevance of this figure to the thesis of the article was not clear, and could have used further explanation.

Table 1 summarized macroevolutionary situations, and their support of either the Red Queen, Court Jester, or Multilevel mixed model. This was an incredibly useful reference, for relating different case studies explored, to the main goal of the article. 
      Figure 3 provided a graphical representation of the phylogenetic relationship between crurotarsans and dinosaurian. The graph shows the general replacement of crurotarsans by dinosaurian during the late Jurassic as discussed in one of the studies explored. The second graph in the figure shows empirical morphospace for archosaurs in the Late Triassic. I felt that the significance of this graph should have been further explained.
