Some species have morphologic data attached to them in the Paleobiology Database. Let's consider the following three species of Ammonite: Glyptophiceras sinuatum, Xenoceltites variocostatus, and Submeekoceras mushbachanum.
Each of these species have morphologic data (e.g., shell width measurements) attached to them in the paleobiology database. You can search for this information by searching taxonomic names here.
                     1. Each of the ammonite specimens in Part I of Lab 2 belongs to one of these three species. Based on 1) the morphologic information on these three species in the Paleobiology Database and 2) the morphologic information from Lab 2, can you tell which specimens belong to which species? Explain your reasoning.
        I cannot tell with absolute certainty which specimens belong to which species, but I can use the information from the Paleobiology Database to make educated guesses about how to groups the specimens. I first got the average width and average diameter measurements for each species from the PBDB. I then divided the average width by the average diameter to get an average ratio between width and diameter for each species as shown below. I did this to try to account for the possibility of age and sexual dimorphism within the species, hoping that the ratio would help lessen the issue of difference in size due differences in specimen sex or maturity. I then loaded the ammonite specimen data from lab 2 into R. I first assigned species to the lab 2 specimens that matched both the average width and diameter measurements from the PBDB very closely. For example, specimen 4 has length and width values very close to the average values given for Glyptophiceras sinuatum on the PBDB. Similarly, specimen 23 closely matches both the average width and average diameter values for Xenoceltites variocostatus.  After I did this, I tried to group the rest of the specimens based on the average width to diameter ratio I calculated. Inconveniently, Xenoceltites variocostatus and Submeekoceras mushbachanum have nearly identical width to ratio values of nearly .26. Therefore,  I had to assign all remaining species with a width to ratio value near .26 based solely on their proximity to average width and diameter values for each species. There were some specimens that did not closely match both of the average diameter or width values of the species, and also did not have width to diameter ratios that resembled those that I calculated for each species. I gave my best guess for these species (marked with an X in the table I created below next to the species names) based on the closeness of only one of the parameters (width, diameter, or W/D) to the PDBD average values. It is very likely that these species assignments were incorrect. 
        One issue with using this method and a probable source of error in grouping the specimens is it did not take account for morphological features such as whorl patterns or ribbing. The species I assigned to lab 2 specimens as shown below are therefore probably not all correct. 


Glyptophiceras sinuatum: Average measurements (in mm): shell width 9.62, shell diameter 40.8
*Average WD = 9.62/40.8 = .2358
Xenoceltites variocostatus: Average measurements (in mm): shell width 6.12, shell diameter 23.5
*Average WD = 6.12/23.5 = .26
Submeekoceras mushbachanum: Average measurements (in mm): shell width 11.0, shell diameter 42.4
*Average WD = 11.0/42.4 = .259

                        1. Look up Xenoceltites variocostatus in the Paleobiology Database. Find the first person (journal paper/reference) to name this species. (Hint: Both the first and second author's last names start with "B"). What is the name of the article?
Smithian (Early Triassic) ammonoid faunas from northwestern Guangxi (South China): taxonomy and biochronology

                        2. Do a google scholar search for this article. Open it and scroll down to the "Plates" subsection. You should see various pictures of different ammonites towards the very end of the article. Find the pictures of Xenoceltites variocostatus. Based on the features in these pictures, can you identify which specimens in Part I of Lab 2 belong to this species?
In the images of Xenoceltites variocostatus, I see fairly well defined ribs in all of the specimens. Therefore, from this visual information alone, I would group specimens 1, 2, 6, 11, 8, 18, 20, 21, 6, and 18 into this the Xenoceltites variocostatus.
