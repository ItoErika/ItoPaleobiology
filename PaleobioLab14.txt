Natural language processing (NLP), PaleoDeepDive, and “dark data”
Problem Set 1:
+Which taxon names appear most often? Print the top 20 taxa. +What are the commonly used or colloquial names for these 20 taxa, if any? (Look them up online if you need to.) +Which of these are probably not good data? Why? +Conversely, which taxa are likely candidates for pyritization, and why?

All of terrestrial taxa are probably not good data. I am including bird taxa in the terrestrial category. So, Lari, Aves, Pici, Farae, Ralli, Alcae, Scopi, Boidae, Acari, Theria, and Galea are probably not good data. 

Convsersely, all marine taxa are likely candidates for pyritization. From the list, this includes Calcarea, Ostracoda, Gastropoda, Annulata, Trilobita, Articulata, and Brachiopoda. 

This makes sense because pyritization requires low oxygen conditions, which only occur in the marine realm. This allows anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria to break down organic matter, and convert it to pyrite via oxidation if there is a sufficient concentration of reactive iron in the water.
