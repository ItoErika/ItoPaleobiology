The Effect of Geographic Range on Extinction Risk During Background and Mass Extinction
by Jonathan Payne and Seth Finnegan (2007)

##Part I

This article sought to answer how significantly geographic range size effects survivorship during background extinctions compared to mass extinctions. Benthic marine invertebrate fossil data from the Paleobiology Database was used to investigate the relationship between geographic range size and genus survivorship over a 500 million year interval, from the Cambrian through the Neogene. A logistic regression was used to study the association between geographic range size and extinction rates. Multiple logistic regression was performed to isolate the influence of range size on survivorship independently from species richness and the number of global occurrences. This confirmed that the positive association between survivorship and range size was not a due to the correlation between range size and those variables. Observed odds ratios were compared to different metrics of sampling record quality to investigate their potential biases. Using these methods, the authors found a significant positive association between geographic range and survivorship in the fossil record. They also found odds ratios of apparent geographic range selectivity were the lowest the for the end-Permian, end-Triassic, and end-Cretaceous mass extinctions. They determined geographic range is an important factor for determining extinction risk in the marine realm in the time interval studied, most significantly during background extinctions. 20 of 47 time intervals investigated showed patterns that were significantly similar to a null model of all genera being equally susceptible to extinction, with the only controlling factor being differences in independent plate extinction probabilities. Most intervals had odds ratios lower than what was consistent with the null model for the probability of global extinction of a genus; intervals that departed most from the null model were mass extinctions and periods of widespread environmental perturbation. They argued this is explained by systematic variation in extinction risk across genera, associated with global environmental disruption during these intervals, which reduced geographic range selectivity. Therefore, during these times, one or several dominant extinction-causing processes induced a similar magnitude of selective ecological or physiological stress all over the planet. Because of this, mass extinctions do not appear to demonstrate preferential survivorship of ecological incumbents. Conversely, during intervals that showed greater geographic range selectivity, various background extinction-causing processes operating at different, more localized locations led to similar plate extinction risk for all genera. The authors concluded that background extinctions are characterized by a lack of widespread disturbances, and are primarily due geographic range selectivity. Thus, background extinctions differ from mass extinctions in the geographic scale of extinction-causing processes.

## Part II

	I appreciated how well the authors described their statistical methods, and their reasons for using them. They clearly explained why a logistic regression was appropriate for analyzing binary data of extinction versus survival. They also outlined the calculation of the odds ratio, and its reflection of the association between geographic range size and survivorship. This was similarly done in the authorsâ€™ calculations of the probability of global extinction. The assumptions implicit in the second formula given in the paper for the probability for global extinction were fully described. The assumptions were that extinction risk a given plate is equivalent for all genera, and that ecological and physiological attributes have no net impact on extinction risk. This thorough quantitative and qualitative description of the models used it easier to grasp their connection to the objective of the study.
	
	I also really liked how the authors explained the implications of the results of their statistical analyses, and why their results were reasonable. For example, they discussed that the lowest odds ratios estimating geographic range selectivity were associated with major mass extinction events. It was explained that these results are consistent with widespread geologic evidence of environmental disturbances during these times. They also explained that if the extinction rate is high on all plates, geographic range has little influence on extinction risk. The inclusion of these rationalities made the article easy to digest.
	
## Part III

      Payne and Finnegan explained that mass extinctions deviate from geographic range selectivity as a result of ecological and physiological stresses acting on a global, or nearly global scale. Several specific ecological and physiological traits that were selected for during the end-Permian and end-Cretaceous mass extinctions were provided. I think it would have been interesting for the authors to provide more information on what physiological and ecological stresses were operating that selected for those traits, and what stresses may have been operating during other intervals of high extinction intensity. 
      
      The Guadalupian mass extinction exhibited significant selectivity on geographic range during. The authors suggested that this was likely due to genera with limited ranges being more likely to appear extinct before their true extinction date based on fossil evidence due to incomplete sampling. This may have led to a false increase in apparent geographic range selectivity in pre-extinction intervals, and reduce the apparent range selectivity of mass extinctions. I did not feel like it was clearly or thoroughly explained explained why this effect would not have skewed the entire study in favor of the overall conclusions of the article.
      
      > Interesting, I'd never really paid attention to that part of the paper before. You raise a good point, I'd have to go back and look at it again.

	Figure 1 illustrates the geographic range selectivity of genera during the Phanerozoic. The graphs show troughs in the trend during the end-Permian, end-Triassic, and end-Cretaceous mass extinctions, reflecting lower range size selectivity as discussed in the article. Graph B demonstrates that geographic range is an important determinant of extinction risk, independent of the confounding variables of species richness and the number of global occurrences. This figure is an excellent representation of the ideas and arguments presented in the article.
	
	Figure 2 is a graph exploring the relationship between geographic range selectivity and extinction intensity, using different time intervals of varying levels of extinction intensity. This figure was included to demonstrate the inverse relationship between geographic range selectivity and extinction selectivity. I felt that the inverse correlation was somewhat unclear based on the graph, and it may have needed a more thorough explanation of how they saw this.
	
	Figure 3 is a graph showing observed geographic range selectivity versus selectivity calculated assuming extinctions are independent across plates. This graph demonstrated that selectivity calculated from the model was generally similar to observed geographic range selectivity, and that the extinctions appear to be outliers. This was a useful figure to reference while reading the article and it supported the conclusions well. 
	
	Table 1 summarized the impact of incomplete sampling on apparent geographic range selectivity by investigating observed odds ratios compared to changes in metrics of record quality. This table demonstrated that most of the metrics had no insignificant impact on the results, confirmed by weak correlations with odds ratios. This figure is important for summarizing and quantifying this information.
