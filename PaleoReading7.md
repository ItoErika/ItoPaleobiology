The Influence of Lithification on Cenozoic Marine Biodiversity Trends
by Austin J. W. Hendy (2009)

> 10/10

## Part I:

This article seeks to answer the question of what ````sources of biases```` there are for causing the difference of estimates between Paleozoic and Cenozoic diversity of benthic, marine genera. 

> I think the paper is a bit more specific than this, no? Also, I'm not wild about your syntax.

Hendy combats previous studies posed by scientists who have argued that diversity at the family level increased three or four-fold from the Paleozoic to the Cenozoic. 

> Is it combat, or a question?

He states that <strike>the</strike> previous studiesâ€™ calculations of alpha diversity, or the average or median diversity of communities through time, did not take into account the increase in availability of unlithified fossiliferous sediments from the late Mesozoic and Cenozoic. 

> I would have led with this statement. Accurate, brief, and clear!

To estimate the impacts of taxonomic information loss with lithification bias, Hendy used a data set of bulk-sampled marine brachiopod- and mollusc-dominated fossil assemblages from New Zealand of the late Miocene through the Pleistocene. He also used various environmental and spatial constraints to investigate the impact of lithification on taxonomic compositional analysis. He organized his samples into three grades of lithification. Mean richness values were assigned to each of the grades, tie intervals, or a combination between the two. A ratio of the difference in diversity between lithified and unlithified comparisons was then calculated. Mineralogy and body size characteristics were also taken into account to investigate the factors causing the varying composition between unlithified and lithified assemblages. Because there is a greater likelihood of fossil recovery in unlithified sediments, Hendy concludes that this bias in unlithified versus lithified preservation over time must also be responsible for at least half of the difference in estimates of diversity between the Paleozoic and Cenozoic benthic marine communities. The increase in estimated diversity from fossil data is coincident with a decrease in lithification of collections over time. Variations in size, robustness, and skeletal composition of the samples may all cause decreased recovery in lithified samples due to preferential removal or destruction.

## Part II

I liked that the author discussed the importance of sampling fossils from stratigraphic units with matrices of similar compositions, with relatively consistent characteristics with time-averaging. By doing this, Hendy did his best in choosing to sample from lithologies that came from similar environmental settings and sedimentary facies. Sedimentary facies have characteristic sedimentation patterns, energy levels, and grain sizes. Since both the rate of sedimentation and energy environment types are incredibly important factors in terms of determining fossil preservation, I appreciated that he took this into account in the study. 

## Part III

I would have liked the author to elaborate on why he believes samples from unlithified sediments would cause the interpretation of higher biodiversity in benthic marine genera than samples from lithified sediments. He mentions the fact that the samples are simply easier to extract from unlithified sediments, and less likely to be destroyed during extraction. He also mentions the preferential destruction of aragonitic skeletal hard parts during the process of lithification due to dissolution during carbonate diagenesis. However, he concludes that this impact on the difference in fossil assemblages from unlithified and lithified sediments is relatively small. He also points out that small or fragile skeletons are more vulnerable to destruction during sediment compaction and more vulnerable to dissolution as well during the lithification process. He only mentions these causes of vulnerability briefly and vaguely in the article. I think delving more deeply into the reasons why unlithified collections and lithified collections present different biodiversity patterns would have shed even more light on the biases of the fossil record that could skew biodiversity data. Understanding these processes associated with lithification that lead to varying fossil vulnerability such as dissolution, diagenesis, weathering, and compaction are key to fully appreciate this article. 

> Great point, and as we discussed in class, the Gwen Daley experiments show that the act of lithification itself is not very destructive.

## Part IV

Figure 1 shows the estimates of past studies that have inferred a two or three-fold increase in diversity of benthic marine communities from the Paleozoic to the Cenozoic. Hendy provides a graph of this increase in number of genera over time from the past study, as well as a graph showing changes the percentage of available unlithified collections over time. The similarity between the trends of these two graphs provides a strong introduction to his overall argument.   

Figure 2 illustrates the impact of lithification on an occurrence-based data set. Graph A shows mean richness generally decreasing with increasing degrees of lithification from the Late Miocene to the Pleistocene. Graph B shows the mean and maximum genus richness decreasing within increasing degrees of lithification. I personally think these figures are rather redundant in terms of what they try to convey, and only one is necessary to include in the article.

Figures 3 and 4 are rarefaction curves, which demonstrate that the richness of a sample of 100 specimens from the New Zealand Wanganui Basin from the Miocene to the Pleistocene is significantly higher in unlithified sediments compared to lithified sediments. I thought these figures illustrated the concept that estimated diversity increased with decreasing grades of lithification for each time interval well. I would not change them. 

Figure 5 is composed of two graphs. Graph A shows a general decrease in genera with aragonitic skeletons in comparison to calcitic skeletons with increasing grades of lithification. Graph B shows a significant drop in the percentage of small genera collected in lithified sediments compared to unlithified sediments. I thought this figure was especially effective in demonstrating some of the factors that may be responsible for distorting estimates of biodiversity or taphonomic changes due to lithification biases through time.

All of the tables were generally helpful in summarizing data trends of genus richness and increase factor as described in the article. These were both useful references to support the conclusions made by Hendy.
